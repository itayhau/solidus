1.  the idea in my solution is to show 30 days in the daily graph which are updated all the time (last day is deleted at the beginning and a new day is added at the end)
     also monthly averages which is constantly updated , and also yearly averages which is constantly updated
     
2. each time 30 day values are reached, there is a new monthly summary (averages) column in the 2nd graph which is showing the current new 30 days data
3. each time 12 month are exceeded, there is a a new year summary (averages) column in the  3rd graph which is showing the current new yearly data
4. in order to examining previous a specific month , or year, the used needs to click the specific month (or year) column which causes the app to pause    (the user can also can click the pause button in order to pause).    when the user clicks on an year, the month data of that years appear and he can click on a specific month to see the days data of the clicked month

5. the use can hover with the mouse on a day and see all the data for that day

6. after pause, when the user clicks resume- then the app continues from the last day of data that was reached (restoring the data before the pause)

7. I implemented the 1st bonus - the user is asked in the console which file he desire to see
